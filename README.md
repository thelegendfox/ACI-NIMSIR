ACI-NIMSIR ("ACI", pronounced A-C-I Nimser) is a system based on NodeJS designed to take the [NIFC Incident Management Situation Report](https://www.nifc.gov/nicc-files/sitreprt.pdf "Found at www.nifc.gov/nicc-files/sitreprt.pdf") (designed for wildland firefighters) and turn it into an easily interpretable CSV (spreadsheet). This is primarily for coding use, though it can be used in other circumstances.

ACI is currently _very_ in-progress, and no features are finalized.

ACI is made by thelegendfox (also known as "jadedcrown" or "Rockethead293"). All Rights Reserved; ACI is currently not permitted for use without written approval.
