# NIFC Incident Management Situation Report to Webhook Module ("SITREPRT")

SITREPRT (non-acronym) is a system based on NodeJS designed to take the [NIFC Incident Management Situation Report](https://www.nifc.gov/nicc-files/sitreprt.pdf "Found at www.nifc.gov/nicc-files/sitreprt.pdf") (designed for wildland firefighters) and turn it into an easily interpretable webhook containing only critical information. This is primarily for use in Hellfire Helibase, though it can be used in other circumstances.

SITREPRT is currently _very_ in-progress, and no features are finalized.

SITREPRT is made by thelegendfox (also known as "jadedcrown" or "Rockethead293"). All Rights Reserved; SITREPRT is currently not permitted for use without written approval.
