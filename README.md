# NIFC Incident Management Situation Report to Webhook Module ("SITREPRT")

SITREPRT (non-acronym) is a system based on NodeJS designed to take the [NIFC Incident Management Situation Report](https://www.nifc.gov/nicc-files/sitreprt.pdf "Found at www.nifc.gov/nicc-files/sitreprt.pdf") (designed for wildland firefighters) and turn it into an easily interpretable webhook containing only critical information.

SITREPRT is currently _very_ in-progress, and no features are finalized.

SITREPRT is intended for use in Hellfire Helibase, as implied by the files specifically pointing to that and having custom Hellfire Helibase assets, as well as how the function is run. Under the CC BY-SA 4.0 license (specified below) you are free to modify it by that license; however, this will take a non-zero amount of coding knowledge. If you would like this to
